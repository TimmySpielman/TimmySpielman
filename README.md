- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimmySpielman
- 👀 I’m interested in security engineering and forensic security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity through coursera and google
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to help learn more and set me up to get a job once certification is complete.  Also to gain knowledge on what else can help me obtain my goals and first job.
